    - If it is the second time mount the board closest to you on the right
    - Test is the tape keeps the board on by nudging the board a bit to see if it moves, replace loose
- After starting the milling process you will be propted to change the milling bit.
    - This is done with by using the two wrenches that are provided on the machine to losen the nut from the shaft of the rotating system. The space for the wrenches is designated by the milled cavity on the top of the machine.
        - Make sure to mount the bit all the way in
        - Make sure to mount the fan with the flat side facing upwards and make sure it is a good distance away from the nut
