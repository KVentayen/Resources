# PCB Milling Machine Notes
## Details
- Model: Bantam Tools $^\text{TM}$ Desktop PCB Milling Machine
- Available Bits:
    - Flat End Mill 1/32" (Is a small looking drill bit)
    - PCB Engraving Bit 0.005" (Has a flat side to it)
- Materials:
    - Single-Sided FR-1
    - Double-Sided FR-1

## Instructions
- To Mount the FR-1 Board use Double Sided Tape
    - Ensure that no piece of tape exceeds the edges of the board
    <!--KIR: Insert Image of example boards here--->
- For convinience select the Loading button under Move in the primary interface, and adjust accordingly
        - **Move > Loading**
        <!--KIR: Insert Screenshot Image Here--->
- Remove board if one is mounted on the platform
- Remove any excess dust from the platform brush or vacuum
- Mount Perf Board onto the Bracket
    - For the first time milling on the board mount towards the left most on the bracket
    <!--KIR: Insert a Picture of the Board--->
    - NOTE: Test the if mounting is secure by nudging the board to see if it moves, replace the tape if loose
- Ensure that the **Outline** is deselected (for the First time)
    - Find under the file name on the right column and next to the other options: Traces and Holes
    <!--KIR: Include a Screenshot of the Image--->
- After starting the milling process you will be propted to change the milling bit.
    - This is done with by using the two wrenches that are provided on the machine to losen the nut from the shaft of the rotating system. The space for the wrenches is designated by the milled cavity on the top of the machine.

        - Make sure to mount the bit all the way in
        - Make sure to mount the fan with the flat side facing upwards and make sure it is a good distance away from the nut
    <!--KIR: Take an Image of this--->
        - Rotate the bit around when mounted to see if it was mounted correctly, watch to see if the tip moves much from the point that it starts
- Once the machine finishes milling one side of the board:
    - If it is a Single Sidded FR-1 Board the Board is complete
    - If it is a Double Sidded FR-1 Board turn it over and remount the board on the other side
        - Similar to the other side ensure that no piece of tape exceeds the edges of the board
- If it is the second time, mount the board closest to you on the right
<!--KIR: Take of the right mounted board--->
- When Preparing to drill the board make sure to select the **Parts to Mill** to **bottom** and **Outline** is selected under the file that is going to be milled
<!--KIR: Take a Screenshot of this--->
- When ready follow the prompt and change the bits accordingly
